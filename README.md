This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in HTML: attempting to access a DOM element that hasn't been defined in the HTML structure. The bug is demonstrated in 'bug.html', while the solution that handles the potential error gracefully can be found in 'bugSolution.html'. This error often silently fails without clear indication of the problem; fixing this enhances overall code robustness.
